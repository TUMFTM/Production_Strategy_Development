# Production_Strategy_Development

Production Strategy Development using Fuzzy Logic:

This project is about production strategy development.
As this process is commonly based on expert knowledge our model allows for a transparent and repeatable decision simulation using fuzzy logic.

The modeled rules and structure may be used for electric vehicle production sites in Africa.

Developed at the Institute of Automotive Technology, Technical University of Munich.

## Getting started

After evaluating product, the company- and country-specific input factors simulate the production configuration.

The decision rule base may be updated use case-specific by adapting the fuzzy logic toolbox of Matlab.

Inputs and output may also be added based on the specific application case.

With the extension for data input via CSV.file and the scripts for automated simulation (Scenario_Simulation.m) and plot of different scenarios (Scenario_Plot.m) the applicability has been improved.

The template of the CSV.file is also included.

The application follows the steps:

1. Enter the values to be simulated in Scenario_Template.csv

2. Import of the template into Matlab

3. Change the number of scenarios in Scenario_Simulation.m

4. Execution of the script Scenario_Simulation.m

5. Execution of the script Scenario_Plot.m
