# Production Strategy Development using Fuzzy Logic

This project is about production strategy development.
As this process is commonly based on expert knowledge our model allows for a transparent and repeatable decision simulation using fuzzy logic.

The modeled rules and structure may be used for electric vehicle production sites in Africa.

----
## Getting started

After evaluating product, the company- and country-specific input factors simulate the production configuration.

The decision rule base may be updated use case-specific by adapting the fuzzy logic toolbox of Matlab.

Inputs and output may also be added based on the specific application case.
